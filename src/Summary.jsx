            into account character traits of characters (personas). The first
            player to score 20 points wins!

            How the Game is Played
          </h2>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6">
            <li>
              <strong>Draw a Persona Card:</strong> The active player draws a
              Persona card that describes a role and a character trait. They
              must play this role for the turn.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Draw a Situation Card:</strong> The active player then
              draws a Situation card that describes a workplace scenario.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Describe the Situation:</strong> The active player
              describes the situation while embodying the Persona they drew,
              using the character traits.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Choose Soft Skills:</strong> The other players analyze the
              situation and choose which Soft Skill they think best solves the
              problem. Each player places their Soft Skill card face down.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Resolution and Points:</strong> All Soft Skill cards are
              turned over. If a card matches the optimal response (according to
              the Situation and Persona combination), the players who chose that
              Soft Skill earn points. The active player also earns a bonus point
              if they described the situation creatively and consistently.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Progress on the Board:</strong> The earned points are
              added to each playerâ€™s score, and their colored pawn moves forward
              on the scoreboard.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Move to the Next Player:</strong> The turn moves to the
              next player, and the game continues until one player reaches the
              target score or all cards are used.
